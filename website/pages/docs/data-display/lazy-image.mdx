title: LazyImage
package: '@nature-ui/image'
description:
  The Lazy Image component is used to lazy load images when it's intersecting in
  the dom.
---

LazyImage component enables you to smartly load the images of your app by
demand, using small placeholders (`fallbackSrc`) while the original image is
being lazy loaded.

This component composes of
[react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer)
so it will only load an image as a page is scrolled.

## Import

```js
import { LazyImage } from '@nature-ui/core';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Container size='xs' centered>
  <Stack spacing='8' col className='w-full'>
    <LazyImage
      className='w-full h-96 object-cover'
      src='https://cutt.ly/qlcgXXE'
      fallbackSrc='https://cutt.ly/dlOXdEI'
      alt='burger 3'
    />
    <LazyImage
      className='w-full h-96 object-cover'
      src='https://cutt.ly/NlOZ0aT'
      fallbackSrc='https://cutt.ly/8lOZvYr'
      alt='burger 1'
    />
  </Stack>
</Container>
```
