description:
  Containers are the most basic layout element in Nature UI. It is used to
  constrain the maximum of the content it wraps.
---

Containers are used to constrain a content's width to the current breakpoint,
while keeping it fluid.

This component uses `tailwindcss` `max-w-*` utility classes to set the max width
of a component.

## Import

```js
import { Container } from '@nature-ui/core';
```

## Usage

To contain any piece of content, wrap it in the `Container` component.

```jsx
<Container>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
  engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
  and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production
</Container>
```

### With size

The `size` prop accepts one of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` or any valid css
width property value.

```jsx
<Container size='sm' centered>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team...
</Container>
```
