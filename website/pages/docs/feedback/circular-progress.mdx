---

The CircularProgress component is used to indicate the progress for determinate
and indeterminate processes.

- Determine progress: fills the circular track with color, as the indicator
  moves from 0 to 360 degrees.
- Indeterminate progress: grows and shrinks the indicator while moving along the
  circular track.

## Import

```js
import { CircularProgress } from '@nature-ui/core';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={80} />
```

### Changing the size

You can add `size` prop to the progress bar to add a custom size.

```jsx
// Change the size to 120px
<CircularProgress value={30} size='120px' />
```

### Changing the thickness

You can add the `thickness` prop to update the thickness of the progress ring.

> The thickness has to be a ratio of the size. Value should be between 0 and 1.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={59} size='100px' thickness='4px' />
```

### Changing the color

You can add `colorScheme` prop to any progress bar to apply any color that
exists in the theme.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={30} colorScheme='orange-400' thickness='12px' />
```

### Adding label

You can add `label` prop to any progress bar to include a label text.

```jsx
<CircularProgress label='40%' value={40} colorScheme='green-400' size='50px' />
```

### Indeterminate Progress

Setting the progress to indeterminate means you're not able to determine the
`value` upfront. Pass the `isIndeterminate` prop to activate this state.

```jsx
<CircularProgress isIndeterminate colorScheme='green-300' />
```

### Accessibility

- Progress has `role` set to `progressbar` to denote that it is a progress bar.
- Progress has `aria-valuenow` set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.
